<h1 align="center">Budget Tracker App</h1>
This application is based on Java and JavaFX for our term project in CS-151 Object Oriented Design. In collaboration with Stephanie Le, Von Victor Salamanca, Bernadette Davoud, and Darwish Jeric Quiambao.

The project attempts to solve the lack of solution for tracking one's budget. We utilized the Software Development Lifecycle principles and object oriented methodology to narrow down the spread of what the application ultimately entails and divide the entire project to smaller phases. This way, there is a better oversight of the whole project and we can identify the necessities of the project and lifecycle of the software in each stage.

The purpose of this software is to help users and people wanting to maintain track of their budget and spending habits. The date is fixed on a 30-day period (or 1 month) to help the user budget their money within that monthThe features are as follows:

The software also includes validation inputs that prompts the user to re-enter the appropriate fields should they enter invalid values. This is done via a dialog box that notifies, alerts, informs, or warns the user of some action that would have prompted the system to throw such messages. Within the structure of the program also lies multiple error handling and exceptions are caught where expected.
